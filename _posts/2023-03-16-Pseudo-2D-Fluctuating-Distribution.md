title: Pseudo-2D Kinetic Theory of Gases Model
---

A Pseudo-2D Kinetic Theory of Gases Model was developed as an adaptation of the 2D Gas Model, removing it's geometric dependence (positions of particles) and replacing it with random activation of agents with random collision partners, whilst attempting to retain reality of the kinetic theory model through incorporation of collision frequency and 2D elastic collisions.

### <b>Speed</b> distribution of a Pseudo 2D Model
The resulting speed distribution from this model is depicted in the diagram below.

The animation shows a near instant relaxation from all individuals having identical velocity into the shape of the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution (fitted to an average of the final 10 distributions).
