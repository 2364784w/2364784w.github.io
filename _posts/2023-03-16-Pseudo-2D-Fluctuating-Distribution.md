title: Pseudo-2D Kinetic Theory of Gases Model
---

A Pseudo-2D Kinetic Theory of Gases Model was developed as an adaptation of the 2D Gas Model, removing it's geometric dependence (positions of particles), whilst attempting to retain reality of the kinetic theory model. 

### Velocity distribution of a Pseudo 2D Model
The resulting velocity distribution from this model is depicted in the diagram below.

The animation clearly shows an instant relaxation from all individuals having identical velocity to forming the shape of the fitted Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (fitted to an average of the final 10 distributions).

### Energy distribution of a Homogenous Saving Parameter simulation
Later, the model incorporated a saving parameter to imitate economic systems. This essentially allows individuals to save a proportion of their energy/wealth from involvement in a transaction. The animation depicted below is of a simulation in which all agents have the same saving parameter (homogenous) of 0.5. The consequence of this parameter is that the exponential shape of the energy distribution of a kinetic theory gas is transformed into a peaked energy distribution seen in the animation below. The causes of this are discussed further in the results section of the thesis.

The animation clearly shows an instant relaxation from all individuals having identical energy to forming the shape of the averaged final distribution for a simulation with a homogenous saving parameter of 0.5. A similar instant relaxation is observed for the model without saving parameter and without
