title: Econophysics - Agent-based modelling of markets from kinetic theory of gases and Brownian motion
---

Within this Master's project, a 2D Kinetic Theory of Gas Model was developed in Python, in particular, using the Mesa agent-based modelling package. The resulting model was visualised using Matplotlib animation and can be seen below:

(LHS) Animation visualising movement of particles within 2D Kinetic Theory of Gases Model. Particles have colour based on their energies. (RHS) Parallel GIF of velocity distribution of particles synchronised to the visualisation in the left figure. Depicts relaxation from initially equal velocity of all agents to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, indicated by the distribution in orange. Note that the MB distribution was fitted to an averaged final velocity distribution.
