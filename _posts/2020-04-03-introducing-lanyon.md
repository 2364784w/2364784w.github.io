title: Econophysics - Agent-based modelling of markets from kinetic theory of gases and Brownian motion
---

Within this Master's project, a 2D Kinetic Theory of Gas Model was developed in Python, in particular, using the Mesa agent-based modelling package. The resulting model was visualised using Matplotlib animation and can be seen below:
